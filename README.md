Welcome to the Brain Tumor Image Preprocessing Toolkit! This open-source project is designed to assist you in preparing and enhancing medical images related to brain tumors for research, diagnosis, or educational purposes. With a wide range of tools and resources, this toolkit simplifies the preprocessing steps required before you dive into your image analysis.

## Features
- **Image Registration:** Ensure images are properly aligned for consistency.
- **Noise Reduction:** Improve image quality by reducing noise and artifacts.
- **Skull Stripping:** Automatically remove non-brain regions for better analysis.
- **Contrast Enhancement:** Adjust brightness and contrast to enhance visibility.
